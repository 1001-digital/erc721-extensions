# ERC721 Contract Extensions
A set of composable extensions for the [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) ERC721 base contracts.

## Available Extensions
### `WithContractMetaData.sol`
Link to your collection's contract meta data right from within your smart contract.

Builds on `Ownable` and allows the contract owner to change contract metadata even after deployment.

Make sure the URL links to an appropriate JSON file.

```solidity
contract Token is ERC721, WithContractMetadata {
  constructor()
    ERC721("Token", "LT")
    WithContractMetadata("ipfs://0123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789/metadata.json")
  {}
}
```

To change the contract metadat URI, call `setContractURI(string uri)` as the contract owner.

### `WithIPFSMetaData.sol`
Handles linking to metadata files hosted on IPFS and follows best practices doing so:

- Projects have to embed the Content ID hash in the contract right from the start
- Project owners can never change the CID
- Tokens link to an `ipfs://`-URL to be independent of particular IPFS Gateways.
- Tokens wrap a folder with a `metadata.json` file (and pot. all the assets of the token).

> **Note**: You should never publish metadata before public sale is complete.<br> <small>This is to prevent people from trying to snipe rare tokens (rarity can be derived from going through all metadata files and looking at the trait and attribute distributions). Although very expensive (in gas fees) to do so, it is potentially possible and thus bad practice.</small>

```solidity
contract CleanToken is ERC721, WithIPFSMetaData {
  constructor()
    ERC721("CleanToken", "CT")
    WithIPFSMetaData("0123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789")
  {}
}
```

#### `WithIPFSMetadataAndPreviewMetadata.sol`
*TODO*

### `WithTransferTimeLock.sol`
To prevent an attack vector right after public sale of tokens, this extension adds a timelock to transfers for 12 hours after initial sale. This gives all buyers enough time to familiarise themselves with their tokens and the entire collection, as well as the rarities of items.

Alternatively: Publish the entire collection without tokenIDs from the get go / or at least all rarity statistics.

*TODO*

### `WithLimitedSupply.sol`
A simple token tracker that limits the token supply.

To keep track of the token supply and to get the next available tokenID, call `nextToken()` when creating new tokens.

```solidity
contract RareToken is ERC721, WithLimitedSupply {
  constructor()
    ERC721("RareToken", "RT")
    WithLimitedSupply(1000) // Max. 1k NFTs available
  {}

  function mint () external ensureAvailability() {
    uint256 newTokenId = nextToken(); // Create a new token ID

    // ...
  }
}
```

The internal `nextToken()` method does not automatically check whether tokens are available but `WithLimitedSupply` provides the `ensureAvailability` modifier that you can attach to your minting function. If you implement minting multiple tokens within the same transaction, you should check availability with the `ensureAvailabilityFor(amount)` modifier.

There are two Contracts that build on this: `LinearlyAssigned`, which adds the option of starting the token tracker from a specific number and `RandomlyAssigned`, which enables semi random token ID assignments.

#### `LinearlyAssigned.sol`
Instantiate it with the max supply as well as the starting index:

```solidity
contract RareToken is ERC721, LinarlyAssigned {
  constructor()
    ERC721("RareToken", "RT")
    LinarlyAssigned(1000, 1) // Max. 1k NFTs available; Start counting from 1 (instead of 0)
  {}

  function mint () external ensureAvailability() {
    uint256 newTokenId = nextToken(); // Create a new token ID

    // ...
  }
}
```

#### `RandomlyAssigned.sol`
(Semi-)randomly* assign token IDs from a fixed collection size on mint.

```solidity
contract RandomToken is ERC721, RandomlyAssigned {
  constructor()
    ERC721("RandomToken", "RT")
    RandomlyAssigned(1000, 1) // Max. 1k NFTs available; Start counting from 1 (instead of 0)
  {}

  function mint () external ensureAvailability() {
    uint256 newTokenId = nextToken(); // Create a new random token ID

    // ...
  }
}
```

> *) We can't create proper random numbers on chain. But this does the job well enough, if you hide your metadata during public sale and are not too valuable of an NFT project (pot. exploit costs a lot of gas, thus making it economically unfeasible to do for profit for 'normal' NFT collections). If you want true random assignment, check out [Chainlink](https://chain.link/).

### `WithSaleStart.sol`
An extension that enables the contract owner to set and update the date of a public sale.

This builds upon the `Ownable` extension, so only contract deployers can change the sale start via `setSaleStart(uint256 time)`.
Also, to stay true to the trustless spirit of NFTs, it is not possible to change the sale start after the initial sale started.

To use this in your project, call the `afterSaleStart` / `beforeSaleStart` modifiers.

```solidity
contract MyToken is ERC721, WithSaleStart {
  constructor()
    ERC721("MyToken", "MT")
    WithSaleStart(1735686000)
  {}

  function claim () external afterSaleStart {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### `LimitedTokensPerWallet.sol`
Limits the amount of tokens an external wallet can hold.

```solidity
contract LimitedToken is ERC721, LimitedTokensPerWallet {
  constructor()
    ERC721("LimitedToken", "LT")
    LimitedTokensPerWallet(3) // Only allow three tokens per wallet
  {}

  // Mint & Transfer limits are taken care of by the library.
}
```

### `OnePerWallet.sol`
A more extreme version of `LimitedTokensPerWallet`, which only allows holding one token in an external wallet address.

To use this in your project just extend the Contract. If you need more control, call the `onePerWallet` modifier. 

```solidity
contract OneForAllToken is ERC721, OnePerWallet {
  constructor()
    ERC721("OneForAllToken", "OFA")
  {}

  // Mints and Transfer limites are taken care of by the library.
}
```

> The above code does not prevent people from minting multiple tokens via a separate smart contract - it only checks against externally owned accounts (wallets with private keys). If you want to account for that, additionally activate the `onePerAccount` modifier on your mint function.

### `WithMarketOffers.sol`
Implements a simple offer based marketplace. Owners of tokens can choose to sell them via the in-built market.

Just extend the `WithMarketOffers.sol` contract to make this work.

### `WithFees.sol`
Aims to abstracts out the complexity of current fee standards.

```solidity
contract SharedUpsideToken is ERC721, WithFees {
  constructor()
    ERC721("SharedUpsideToken", "SUP")
    // 500 Basis Points (5%) of secondary sales 
    // should go to the given beneficiary address
    WithFees(0xe11Da9560b51f8918295edC5ab9c0a90E9ADa20B, 500)
  {}

  function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view override(WithFees, ERC721) returns (bool) {
    return WithFees.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
  }
}
```

### `WithWithdrawals.sol`
A simple helper that implements a withdrawal function.

Just call `withdraw` as the contract owner.
